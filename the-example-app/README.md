Content model: The example app
================================

The example app content model containts the model for all the example apps, demonstrating in a broader fashion some examples on how to use
Contentful. If you want to see the model in action, we have a [hosted version](https://the-example-app-nodejs.contentful.com/), for you
to check out.

Through our [command line app](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli) you can import this model into your own space. Doing so will be
accomplished by this call to the command line app:

```
contentful space seed -s '<SPACE_ID>' -t the-example-app
```

The Contentful CLI will walk you through the steps needed in order to import this content model into your space.

If you happen to not have a `<SPACE_ID>`, as in a Space you can overwrite, use the cli to create a new one:

```
contentful space create -n '[COPY] The example app'
```

And then retry the upper code again.
