What is `The Example App model`?
================================

The example app content model containts the model for all the example apps, demonstrating in a broader fashion some examples on how to use
Contentful. If you want to see the model in action, we do have a [hosted version](https://contentful-example-app.herokuapp.com/), for you
to check out.

Through our [command line app](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli) you can push this model to your own space. Doing so will be
accomplished by this call to the command line app:

```
contentful space seed the-example-app
```

The app will walk you through the steps needed in order to fill your space.

Other apps
==========

The Node example app is not the only one. Soon™ there will be more available, all using the
same space.

Stay tuned for updates on the model and example apps.
